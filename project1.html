        <h2>Fire Detection Using Deep Learning</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The goal of the project is to use image processing technology to detect
            fires and notify people. Numerous automatic fire alarm systems already exist,
            such as the sensor-based method, which has limitations. This project is 
            implemented by connecting a webcam as hardware and using the PyCharm IDE.</p>

        <h3>System Overview</h3>
        <p>The project mainly focuses on computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
            We utilize Python's OpenCV library for image processing, and the webcam captures the 
            surrounding video feed to analyze it in real-time. The project aims to detect fire as early 
            as possible and work in various environments.</p>

        <h3>Existing System</h3>
        <p>In the existing system, fires in forests are detected using physical sensors, which can 
            be limited by environmental factors. These systems are often unable to detect fires in the 
            early stages, making them less effective in preventing large-scale damage. The Internet of 
            Things (IoT) is commonly used to connect devices and exchange data in real time.</p>

        <h3>Proposed System</h3>
        <p>We propose an image-based fire detection system that leverages computer vision techniques. 
            Our dataset consists of sequential video frames with fire and non-fire images. The proposed 
            method consists of three stages:</p>
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>Fire pixel detection using RGB and YCbCr color models</li>
            <li>Moving pixel detection to track changes in the video</li>
            <li>Analyzing the shape of fire-colored pixels to determine if itâ€™s fire</li>
        </ul> -->

        <h3>Flow Diagram of the Proposed System</h3>
        <img src="Flow-chart-of-fire-picture-detection-based-on-convolutional-neural-network.png" alt="Flow Diagram of Fire Detection" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
        <p>The flow diagram outlines the steps in the proposed fire detection system, showing how the
            deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to classify fire versus non-fire images.
            The system captures video frames and processes them through the neural network for 
            classification. If fire is detected, it triggers an alert; otherwise, no action is taken.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>By integrating image processing and deep learning techniques, our system aims to improve 
            fire detection accuracy and speed, offering an advantage over traditional sensor-based 
            systems. It has the potential to operate in various environments, reducing the risk of 
            fire-related disasters.</p>
